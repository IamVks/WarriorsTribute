        <h2>What is this Corona Virus?</h2>
        <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most
            coronaviruses aren't dangerous.In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
            COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract
            infection.<br> <br>It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower
            respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly. SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.

        <h2>We Salute You</h2>
        <p>You have clapped, clanged utensils, lit diyas to salute
            their bravery. Those on the frontlines of this war against the coronavirus. But there’s another side.Every doctor, every policeman, and every health service personnel has a fight much bigger than the pandemic itself — the fight against their own fears. Yes,
            they are doctors, policemen, sanitisation workers, but they are human beings first. They get scared too, and beating that fear requires mental strength.They risk their life so that we can breath peacefully.=Its time to thank them whole heartedly.Because of them we are alive.
